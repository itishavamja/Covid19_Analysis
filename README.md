# Covid19_Analysis

Process COVID-19 daily confirmed case data
-Calculate the maximum daily infection rate for each country
-Merge the result with the World Happiness Report 2020
-Analyze relationships between the infection rate and happiness indicators such as:
-GDP per capita
-Social support
-Healthy life expectancy

Datasets Used
- covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv – Johns Hopkins University dataset containing time-series confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- worldwide_happiness_report.csv – Dataset based on the World Happiness Report 2020.

-Merged COVID-19 data with happiness indicators based on country names.
-Plotted scatterplots and regression lines to observe relationships between:
-GDP per capita vs. max infection rate
-Social support vs. max infection rate
-Life expectancy vs. max infection rate

Line Plots showing the spread of COVID-19 over time in countries like China, Italy, and Spain.
Scatter & Regression Plots illustrating how infection rates may relate to happiness factors.
